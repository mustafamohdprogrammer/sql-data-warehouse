# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  
This project demonstrates a complete **data warehousing and analytics solution**, from building a data warehouse to delivering actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights **industry best practices** in data engineering and analytics.

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture** with **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:

- **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data exactly as received from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into SQL Server.
- **Silver Layer**: Cleanses, standardizes, and normalizes data to make it analysis-ready.
- **Gold Layer**: Contains business-ready data modeled into a **Star Schema** for reporting and analytics.
